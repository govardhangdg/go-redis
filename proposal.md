#### Name: Govardhan G D
#### Class: Btech third year CSE

####Interests: 
I like working with code close to the hardware. I like to see what the code is doing without the abstarctions. 
My favourite discipline of Computer science is operating systems and handling concurrency, the various models given by programming languages to handle concurrency(like CSP in golang, asyncIO in python, Rust, javascript)

####Programming Languages: 
Python, Javascript, C, Rust, Golang, Java, Ruby

####Preferred languages: 
Rust and python

#### Why I chose this project and why you may consider me: 
I have been interested in the distributed and decentralized systems for a while and also learning about them, especially the consensus algorithms like raft and paxos(although I have not revised these concepts in a while and am rusty in them now). I am also involved in a project which is about creating a decentralized social network using the libp2p library as a part of IEEE. I have thought about implementing Raft by myself a few times and haven't been able to move past a certain point. So I hope to do it as a part of a team, which will be important when I hit a roadblock.
